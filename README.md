# End-to-end Integrated Tariff-Model of the country
I have created an Integrated Tariff model of the entire country by utilizing the data of several parameters received from all Power Distribution Companies (DISCOs).
A separate schema was created for each parameter in MySQL.
A thorough algorithm was then developed in Python to transfer the data in MySQL schemas using MySQL Python API (MySQLdb).
